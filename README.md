# Riverr - Senior Frontend Technical Test - ATTY C

I've writte the review. There's quite a lot there. I've also refactored some of the code.
  
### With more time I would:
* Complete the refactor including extracting the Table Component, and the form functions into a helper file with the structure 
  /helpers
    -index.js
    formHelpers.js
    * I started this but didn;t have time ti finishe to have commented out the import.
* Look into the useage of TypeScript
* write tests
